# MaterialNameless
Material Design meets [@samerton/NamelessMC](https://github.com/samerton/NamelessMC/) and something awesome is made! (Modest, huh?)

## Why?
Fun project.

## How do I use it?
1. Download the project as a ZIP
2. Extract the files
3. Navigate to `/themes/Material/css` and rename `bootstrap-modified.css` to `bootstrap.min.css` (Currently NamelessMC doesn't support custom stylesheet names)
4. Now navigate to the root of your NamelessMC installation, and copy `/themes/Material/*` to `Nameless/styles/themes/Material/*`
5. Copy `/templates/Material/*` to `Nameless/styles/templates/Material/*`
6. Install and Activate the theme and the template from the Admin CP of your Nameless installation.
